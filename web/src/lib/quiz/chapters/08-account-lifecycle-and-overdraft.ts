        "Which account status is the fully operational state — accepting debits, credits, and new hold authorizations?",
      options: ["Dormant", "Frozen", "Active", "Closed"],
      answer: 2,
      explanation:
        "An [[account-status|Active]] account is the fully operational state. [[account-status|Dormant]] restricts to credits only; [[account-status|Frozen]] permits only balance viewing; [[account-status|Closed]] accepts no transactions at all.",

      concept: "account-status",
      prompt: "A salary credit arrives for a Dormant account. What happens?",
      options: [
        "The credit is rejected — dormant accounts accept no transactions",
        "The credit is accepted and the account reactivates to Active",
        "The credit is accepted but the account stays Dormant",
        "The credit is held pending an explicit reactivation request",
      ],
      answer: 1,
      explanation:
        "[[account-status|Dormant]] accounts accept incoming credits — and any credit (or customer-initiated activity) triggers reactivation to Active. This ensures legitimate incoming funds never bounce off a forgotten account.",

      concept: "account-status",
      prompt:
        "An account was Dormant when a fraud alert caused it to be Frozen. The alert is cleared and the freeze lifted. Which state does the account return to?",
      options: [
        "Active — unfreeze always resets to the default operating state",
        "Dormant — the Frozen state remembers and restores the prior state",
        "Closed — a fraud flag triggers account termination",
        "It remains Frozen until an explicit reactivation request from the customer",
      ],
      answer: 1,
      explanation:
        "The [[account-status|Frozen]] state remembers the previous state. Lifting the freeze restores the account to what it was before — Dormant in this case. An account that was Active when frozen would return to Active; Dormant returns to Dormant.",

        "A customer with no overdraft facility tries to debit $600 from an account with a $400 available balance. What happens?",
      options: [
        "The transaction posts and the book balance becomes −$200",
        "The transaction is hard-declined before any ledger entry is made",
        "A $600 hold is placed and the debit is queued for later",
        "$400 is debited and the remaining $200 is returned as a partial rejection",
      ],
      answer: 1,
      explanation:
        "Without an arranged [[overdraft]], the system applies a hard decline — the transaction is refused before reaching the ledger. The [[balance-available|available balance]] is the gate; a debit that would push it below zero is rejected outright with an insufficient-funds error.",

        "A customer has a $0 book balance and a $500 arranged overdraft limit. A $300 debit is approved. What is the resulting book balance?",
      options: [
        "$0 — the overdraft limit absorbs the debit without touching the book balance",

        "+$300 — the bank credits the account for providing the facility",
        "$500 — the full limit is drawn down immediately",
      ],
      answer: 1,
      explanation:
        "An arranged [[overdraft]] allows the book balance to go negative. After the $300 debit, the book balance is −$300, meaning the customer owes the bank $300. The remaining overdraft capacity is $200 ($500 limit minus $300 used).",

        "Book balance + Overdraft limit",
        "Book balance + Overdraft limit − Active holds",
        "Book balance − Overdraft limit − Active holds",
      ],
      answer: 2,
      explanation:
        "[[balance-available]] = Book balance + Overdraft limit − Active holds. The overdraft limit raises the floor of what is spendable; [[holds]] lower it. Without an overdraft facility, the limit term is zero, simplifying to the familiar book-minus-holds formula.",

      prompt:
        "A deposit account's book balance falls from +$500 to −$200 after an authorized overdraft debit. From the bank's perspective, which best describes the resulting −$200 position?",
      options: [
        "A $200 liability — the bank still owes the customer $200",
        "A $200 asset — the customer now owes the bank $200",
        "A $200 equity reduction recorded against the bank's capital",
        "No balance-sheet impact — overdraft entries are off-balance-sheet",
      ],
      answer: 1,
      explanation:
        "A deposit is normally an [[account-type-liability]] — the bank owes the customer. When the book balance turns negative, the relationship inverts: the customer owes the bank, so the outstanding amount appears as a receivable (an asset) on the bank's balance sheet. A negative liability is economically equivalent to an asset.",

      concept: "holds",
      prompt:
        "An account manager tries to close an Active account that has a zero book balance but one unresolved hold authorization. What should happen?",
      options: [
        "The account closes — the book balance is what matters for closure",
        "The close is rejected — all outstanding holds must be resolved first",
        "The hold is automatically released and the account closes immediately",
        "The hold is converted to a debit entry before closure proceeds",
      ],
      answer: 1,
      explanation:
        "Closing an account requires the book balance to be exactly zero **and** all [[holds]] to be resolved (and all scheduled payments cancelled). An outstanding hold represents funds reserved but not yet captured or released; the account cannot be closed until the hold is settled.",

      difficulty: "challenge",
      prompt:
        "An account has a book balance of −$400, an arranged overdraft limit of $500, and no active holds. A $200 debit arrives. There is no unarranged overdraft coverage. What is the outcome?",
      options: [
        "Approved — the book balance of −$400 is still within the $500 limit",
        "Declined — the available balance is only $100, which is insufficient for a $200 debit",
        "Approved as a courtesy unarranged extension at a higher fee",
        "Queued — the system waits for the balance to recover before retrying",
      ],
      answer: 1,
      explanation:
        "Available balance = book (−$400) + limit ($500) − holds ($0) = $100. The requested $200 exceeds the available $100, so the debit is declined. The overdraft limit does not allow unlimited spending — once the available balance is exhausted the account behaves like one with no overdraft facility.",

      id: "ch8-q10",
      difficulty: "challenge",
      concept: "balance-book",
      prompt:
        "Why does the overdraft authorization gate check the available balance rather than the book balance?",
      options: [
        "The book balance is only settled at end of day, so it lags real-time",
        "Active holds represent committed funds not yet deducted from the book balance; ignoring them would allow double-spending",
        "Regulators require available-balance checks for all credit facilities",
        "The book balance is inaccessible to the business layer during authorization",
      ],
      answer: 1,
      explanation:
        "[[balance-book|Book balance]] does not subtract active [[holds]] — a hold reserves funds without yet debiting the ledger. Checking only the book balance would let a customer spend the same reserved funds twice. The available balance formula (book + overdraft limit − holds) captures the true spendable position.",

      prompt:
        "A payment posted to an account can be reversed even after the account has been Closed.",
      answer: false,
      explanation:
        "A [[account-status|Closed]] account is a terminal state that accepts no transactions — including [[reversal|reversals]]. Any correction to entries associated with a closed account must be routed through a separate open account. The historical ledger entry remains intact; the account is simply no longer writable.",

      prompt:
        "With an arranged overdraft limit of $300, a deposit account's book balance can legitimately reach −$300.",
      answer: true,
      explanation:
        "An arranged [[overdraft]] explicitly permits the book balance to go negative, down to the negative of the limit. At −$300 exactly, the entire limit is consumed but not breached. The customer owes the bank $300 — economically this is a short-term loan.",

      prompt:
        "When a deposit account is overdrawn, the outstanding negative balance appears on the bank's balance sheet as an asset.",
      answer: true,
      explanation:
        "A deposit is normally a liability — the bank owes the customer. An overdrawn account inverts that relationship: the customer now owes the bank, making the outstanding balance a receivable — an [[account-type-asset]]. The bank has effectively extended a short-term loan and holds a claim against the customer.",

      difficulty: "challenge",
      concept: "double-entry",
      prompt:
        "When a debit drives a deposit account's balance below zero, the double-entry accounting principle is violated because there is no matching credit.",
      answer: false,
      explanation:
        "[[double-entry]] is never violated. A debit to the deposit account (reducing the liability or creating a receivable) is always matched by an equal credit elsewhere — for example, cash paid out or another account credited. Going negative changes the economic interpretation but not the bookkeeping structure; every entry remains balanced.",

      options: [
        "The book balance must be exactly zero",
        "All active hold authorizations must be resolved",
        "The account must have been Active for at least 30 days",
        "All scheduled payments must be cancelled",
        "The account must pass through Dormant before it can be Closed",
      ],
      answers: [0, 1, 3],
      explanation:
        "Closing requires three conditions: the [[balance-book|book balance]] must be exactly zero, all [[holds]] must be resolved, and all scheduled payments must be cancelled. There is no minimum operating age and no mandatory Dormant step — [[account-status|Closed]] is reached directly from Active once these financial conditions are met.",

        "Dormant",
        "Frozen (full freeze)",
        "Closed",
      ],
      answers: [2, 3],
      explanation:
        "[[account-status|Active]] accepts all transactions; [[account-status|Dormant]] explicitly accepts credits and uses them to trigger reactivation. A fully [[account-status|Frozen]] account permits only balance viewing — all postings, including credits, are blocked. [[account-status|Closed]] accepts nothing. (A partial freeze may allow credits while blocking debits, but a full freeze does not.)",

      explanation:
