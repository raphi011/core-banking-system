      concept: "double-entry",
      prompt:
        "A transaction is described as a 'balanced set of entries posted atomically.' What does 'balanced' mean here?",
      options: [
        "The transaction touches the same number of debit and credit accounts",
        "Total debits equal total credits across all legs of the transaction",
        "The transaction must involve exactly two accounts",
        "The ledger has been verified by an auditor",
      ],
      answer: 1,
      explanation:
        "In [[double-entry]] bookkeeping every transaction must balance — total debits must equal total credits, however many legs there are. The *number* of accounts is irrelevant; the *sums* must match.",

      concept: "reversal",
      prompt:
        "To correct an incorrectly posted transaction, the right procedure is to edit or delete it in the ledger.",
      answer: false,
      explanation:
        "The ledger is **immutable and append-only** — posted transactions are never edited or deleted. To correct an error, a [[reversal]] is posted: a new transaction in which every original debit becomes a credit and vice versa, netting the effect to zero while preserving the full audit trail.",

      concept: "idempotency-key",
      prompt:
        "Why does a payment API require callers to supply an idempotency key with each request?",
      options: [
        "To authenticate the caller's identity and authorise the transaction",
        "To prevent the same logical operation from being posted twice if the request is retried",
        "To compress and route the request through the payment network",
        "To assign the transaction to a specific subledger",
      ],
      answer: 1,
      explanation:
        "Networks fail in the worst way: they lose the *response*, not the request. The [[idempotency-key]] is a unique identifier the caller assigns once per logical operation. If the same key arrives twice, the server recognises it and refuses to create a duplicate — the client can then look up the original transaction by that key.",

        "A bank's General Ledger contains a 'Customer Deposits' subledger holding 50,000 individual accounts. What does the General Ledger show for this subledger?",
      options: [
        "The balance of every individual customer account, listed separately",

        "Only the most recently posted transaction across all accounts",
        "An alphabetical index of all customer account names",
      ],
      answer: 1,
      explanation:
        "The [[ledger-vs-subledger]] hierarchy exists so the General Ledger can show one summary total while the subledger holds the individual detail. If Customer Deposits sum to $10 M, the GL shows $10 M — not 50,000 lines. The subledger is where the per-customer granularity lives.",

      concept: "booking-date",
      prompt:
        "The booking date is the date a transaction is recorded in the system, which may differ from the date it takes economic effect.",
      answer: true,
      explanation:
        "Every transaction carries two dates. The [[booking-date]] is when the system records the transaction; the value date is when it takes economic effect (e.g., when interest starts accruing). The two can diverge by days — a weekend wire transfer or a back-dated correction are common examples.",

      concept: "double-entry",
      prompt:
        "A customer sends $100 and the bank charges a $3 transfer fee. The transaction posts three legs: sender debited $100, recipient credited $97, fee-income account credited $3. Why does the system accept this posting?",
      options: [
        "Because the sender's debit equals the recipient's credit ($100 = $97) — the fee is ignored",
        "Because three-leg transactions are always accepted regardless of balance",
        "Because total debits ($100) equal total credits ($97 + $3 = $100)",
        "Because the fee-income account is a revenue account and requires no balancing entry",
      ],
      answer: 2,
      explanation:
        "[[double-entry]] requires total debits = total credits across *all* legs, not just one debit against one credit. The three-leg fee split works because $100 debit = $97 + $3 credits. The number of legs is unlimited; the balance invariant is not.",

      concept: "idempotency-key",
      prompt:
        "A payment request with idempotency key 'pay-xyz-001' is submitted and the transfer is posted successfully. The same request — identical key — is submitted again ten seconds later. What does the server do?",
      options: [
        "Posts a second transfer and the customer is charged twice",
        "Rejects the second submission and signals that this key was already used",
        "Posts a reversal of the original transfer automatically",
        "Silently discards the retry and returns a blank response",
      ],
      answer: 1,
      explanation:
        "[[idempotency-key]] deduplication: the server stores which keys it has processed. Seeing the same key again, it refuses to create a duplicate and signals that the key was already used — the client can then look up the original transaction by that key rather than guessing whether the first attempt succeeded.",

      kind: "truefalse",
      id: "ch5-q8",
      difficulty: "core",
      prompt:
        "After a reversal transaction is posted, the original transaction is permanently removed from the ledger.",
      answer: false,
      explanation:
        "The ledger is **append-only**. A reversal posts a *new* transaction that exactly offsets the original — it does not remove anything. The original remains visible, marked as 'reversed,' and the reversal carries a back-reference to it. Both transactions form a permanent, auditable record.",

      concept: "account-type-revenue",
      prompt:
        "In the three-leg fee-split transaction (sender debited $100, recipient credited $97, fee-income credited $3), what type of account is fee-income?",
      options: [
        "Asset — the bank now holds $3 more cash",
        "Liability — the bank owes $3 to a third party",
        "Revenue — the fee is income earned by the bank",
        "Expense — the fee represents a processing cost",
      ],
      answer: 2,
      explanation:
        "A transfer fee is income the bank earns for its service. It flows into a [[account-type-revenue]] account, which has a **credit normal balance** — crediting it increases the bank's recognised income. A common error is to think cash is received, so an asset must be credited; the cash leg is elsewhere (or implicit in clearing), and the fee record itself is revenue.",

      concept: "reversal",
      prompt:
        "A reversal transaction is posted to cancel a mistaken entry. Which statement correctly describes the relationship between the original and the reversal in the ledger?",
      options: [
        "The reversal replaces the original; the original record is deleted",
        "Both transactions exist; the reversal carries a back-reference to the original, and the original is marked 'reversed'",
        "The reversal and original are merged into a single net-zero transaction",
        "The original is hidden from reporting but stored in a separate archive",
      ],
      answer: 1,
      explanation:
        "An immutable ledger never deletes or merges entries. A [[reversal]] is a new, independent transaction that references the transaction it undoes. The original is marked 'reversed' for reporting; the reversal shows the correction. Two true facts coexist in the record: the error happened, and it was later corrected.",

      options: [
        "Total debits equal total credits across all entries",
        "The transaction must have exactly two entries — one debit and one credit",
        "All entries are recorded together atomically — either all succeed or none do",
        "Any number of entries is allowed, provided total debits and credits balance",
        "A transaction may be partially committed if some legs succeed and one fails",
      ],
      answers: [0, 2, 3],
      explanation:
        "[[double-entry]] transactions are **balanced** (debits = credits) and **atomic** (all-or-nothing). They may have any number of legs — a two-legged transfer and a three-legged fee split are equally valid. Partial commits are forbidden: if any leg fails, the whole transaction is rejected and nothing is recorded.",

      prompt:
        "A fee-split transaction posts two credit entries: a recipient account credited 9700 units and a fee-income account credited 300 units. Both amounts are in minor currency units (cents). What is the total value of all credits expressed in dollars?",
      answer: 100,
      unit: "dollars",
      tolerance: 0,
      explanation:
        "9700 cents + 300 cents = 10 000 cents. [[amount-cents]] — storing amounts as integer minor units avoids floating-point errors. 10 000 cents ÷ 100 = **$100**. The sender was debited $100, and the two credit legs sum to the same amount, confirming the transaction is balanced.",

      concept: "idempotency-key",
      prompt:
        "A mobile banking app sends a $75 transfer. The server records the transfer but the response is lost before reaching the app. The app retries with the same idempotency key. What is the correct server behavior?",
      options: [
        "Post a second $75 transfer — the first may not have fully succeeded",
        "Reject the retry permanently as a suspected replay attack",
        "Recognise the key, refuse to post a duplicate, and signal that this key was already used so the app can look up the original",
        "Post a $75 reversal to cancel the first transfer, then post a fresh one",
      ],
      answer: 2,
      explanation:
        "This is the exact problem [[idempotency-key]] solves. A lost response does not mean a lost transaction — the server already committed. Retrying with the **same** key is safe: the server finds the key in its records and signals it was already used. The customer is charged exactly once regardless of network failures.",

      answer: 97,
      unit: "dollars",
      tolerance: 0,
      explanation:
        "Debit side: $100. Credit side must also total $100: $3 to fee income + $97 to recipient = $100. [[amount-cents]] records these as 10 000, 300, and 9700 integer cents respectively. The recipient's account is credited **$97**.",

      prompt: "Debiting a liability account always increases its balance.",
      answer: false,
      explanation:
        "Each account type has a [[normal-balance]] direction. Liabilities have a **credit** normal balance: a credit *increases* the liability and a debit *decreases* it. Debiting a customer's deposit account (a liability) reduces the bank's obligation to that customer — it doesn't grow the balance.",

        "Every debit in the original becomes a credit in the reversal, and vice versa",
        "The reversal carries a reference back to the transaction it cancels",

        "The net economic effect across all affected accounts is zero after the reversal is posted",
        "The original transaction disappears from audit logs once reversed",
      ],
      answers: [0, 1, 3],
      explanation:
        "A [[reversal]] exactly mirrors the original (debit↔credit flip) and references the transaction it cancels. Because it is a perfect mirror, the combined net effect on every affected account is zero. The ledger is append-only: the original is never edited or removed — only marked 'reversed.' Both records remain in audit logs permanently.",

      options: [
        "Posts the transaction and flags it for manual review, since the imbalance is small",
        "Rejects the entire transaction — no entries are recorded",
        "Posts the legs that fit within the debit total and discards the remainder",
        "Automatically adds a balancing credit entry to make up the $10 difference",
      ],
      answer: 1,
      explanation:
        "The ledger enforces the balance invariant strictly: total debits must equal total credits. Here debits = $100 but credits = $60 + $30 = $90 — a $10 shortfall. The system rejects the **entire** transaction atomically; no partial posting occurs. The caller must correct the entries and resubmit with a balanced set.",

What is the net credit to the customer's deposit account in dollars?",

      explanation:
        "The customer's deposit receives two legs in the same transaction: a credit of $10,000 and a debit of $200 (origination fee). Net: $10,000 − $200 = **$9,800**. [[amount-cents]] arithmetic: 1 000 000 − 20 000 = 980 000 cents = $9,800. All four legs balance: total debits ($10,000 + $200) = total credits ($10,000 + $200) = $10,200.",
