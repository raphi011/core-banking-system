      explanation:
        "[[scheme-direction-push]] — in SCT the payer's bank initiates and pushes funds to the payee. No [[mandate]] is required because the payer is authorising the debit themselves. It settles at T+1 via the ISO 20022 `pacs.008` interbank message.",

        "What is the core reason SEPA Direct Debit (SDD) requires a mandate before any collection?",
      options: [
        "SDD is a gross-settlement scheme that requires pre-authorisation",
        "The creditor's bank reaches into the debtor's account, so the debtor must pre-authorise it",
        "The central bank mandates pre-authorisation for all SEPA pull payments",
        "SDD always requires the payer's bank to confirm the instruction before debiting",
      ],
      answer: 1,
      explanation:
        "SDD is a [[scheme-direction-pull]] — the creditor initiates the debit on the debtor's account. A [[mandate]] is the standing authorisation the debtor signs in advance, naming the specific creditor and often capping the amount. Without a valid mandate the collection is rejected before any posting occurs.",

      answer: 3,
      explanation:
        "[[scheme-direction-pull]] — SDD is a pull scheme whose interbank message is **pacs.003**. The SCT counterpart (a push) uses `pacs.008`. `pain.001` is a customer-to-bank initiation message; `camt.054` is a bank-to-customer notification, not an interbank instruction.",

      answer: 1,
      explanation:
        "The [[mandate]] status check fires before any posting. A mandate that exists but has been revoked triggers **ErrMandateRevoked**. `ErrMandateRequired` fires when no mandate exists at all; `ErrMandateExceeded` fires when the collection amount exceeds the mandate limit.",

      explanation:
        "[[allows-return]] — SEPA's R-transaction family includes both *returns* (dispute or failed funds) and *refunds*. The **refund** gives the debtor an **8-week**, no-questions-asked window to reclaim any settled SDD collection. After that window a dispute must be substantiated; it is no longer automatic.",

      answer: 1,
      explanation:
        "The [[debtor-leg]] — the entry debiting the payer's deposit account and crediting the bank's clearing suspense — posts at **initiation/acceptance**, value-dated to the settlement date. Clearing later computes net positions; settlement posts the creditor leg. No debit to the customer's account occurs at clearing itself.",

      ],
      answer: 2,
      explanation:
        "The [[creditor-leg]] posts at **settlement**: only after central-bank reserves have moved from the debtor's bank to the creditor's bank does the creditor's bank credit the payee's deposit account (and debit its own reserve asset). The debtor leg posts earlier, at initiation, into the initiating bank's clearing suspense.",

        "In 'Cleared', both banks have confirmed receipt; in 'Settled', the central bank has confirmed",
      ],
      answer: 1,
      explanation:
        "[[clearing-vs-settlement]] — clearing computes the **net** amounts each bank owes, but no central-bank money moves yet. Settlement is the moment of finality: reserves transfer between banks at the central bank and the [[creditor-leg]] posts, delivering funds to the payee. Only after settlement can a return unwind the flow.",

        "Automatically updates the mandate cap to €450 and proceeds",
      ],
      answer: 1,
      explanation:
        "The [[mandate]] amount cap is a hard gate, not advisory. Even when every other mandate check passes, a collection exceeding the mandate limit is rejected with **ErrMandateExceeded** before any posting occurs. There is no partial approval or automatic cap increase.",

        "Cancelled — both banks delete the original postings",
      ],
      answer: 2,
      explanation:
        "The [[payment-lifecycle]] has a 'Returned' terminal state, reachable *only* after settlement via a SEPA R-transaction. A return is not an undo of the lifecycle — it posts new compensating entries that restore both balances while leaving the original entries intact in the ledger.

      explanation:
        "SDD is a [[scheme-direction-pull]] payment. The **creditor's** bank initiates the collection from the debtor's account. Because the creditor is reaching into someone else's account, a signed [[mandate]] is required before any debit can proceed.",

        "Once mandate checks pass for an SDD, the accounting postings follow a different path from an SCT — the pull direction requires separate posting logic.",
      answer: false,
      explanation:
        "Once the mandate gate clears, SDD uses **exactly the same posting engine** as SCT: debtor → clearing suspense → central-bank reserves → creditor. This is a key insight of the [[payment-lifecycle]]: only the rules governing initiation and authorisation differ — the underlying ledger choreography is shared by both schemes.",

        "In this model, SEPA Direct Debit settles one business day after initiation (T+1), the same as SEPA Credit Transfer.",
      answer: false,
      explanation:
        "[[settlement-delay]] — this model settles SDD at **T+2**, not T+1. SCT settles at T+1. The longer SDD delay reflects that a pull collection is tied to a due date; real SDD Core works similarly, though it is driven by the mandate's due date rather than a fixed two-day offset.",

      answer: false,
      explanation:
        "Ledgers are immutable — entries are never deleted. [[allows-return]] — a return works like a [[reversal]] across banks: new **compensating transactions** are posted that exactly offset the original flow, leaving net balances at zero. Both the original and compensating entries remain permanently in the ledger history.",

      explanation:
