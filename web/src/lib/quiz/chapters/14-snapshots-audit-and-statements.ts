        "What does an end-of-day snapshot record for each deposit account?",
      options: [
        "The value-date book balance, holds, and available balance at close of business",

      answer: 0,
      explanation:
        "A [[snapshot]] captures the three-part deposit balance — value-date book balance, holds, and available balance — at close of business. The value-date balance is used (not the booking-date balance) because it is the economically real position that drives interest accrual and regulatory reporting.",

      answers: [0, 1, 2, 3],
      explanation:
        "[[snapshot|Snapshots]] serve four purposes: interest accrual, statement generation, regulatory reporting, and query performance (balance at any date is read from the nearest snapshot plus subsequent transactions). Snapshots do not block payment processing — payments post to the ledger independently.",

      concept: "snapshot",
      prompt:
        "An end-of-day snapshot records the value-date balance, not the booking-date balance.",
      answer: true,
      explanation:
        "[[snapshot|Snapshots]] capture the **value-date** balance — the economically real position. Interest and regulation care about when money is economically effective, not merely when an entry was logged. The booking-date balance can differ when a posting is recorded before its value date arrives.",

        "On a bank statement, the transaction listing is ordered by which date?",
      options: [
        "Value date — when money becomes economically effective",

        "Settlement date — when interbank reserves moved",
        "The date the customer authorized the transaction",
      ],
      answer: 1,
      explanation:
        "The [[statement]] transaction listing uses **booking date** — the date the entry appeared in the ledger, which is the date the customer associates with their activity (\"I made this payment on Feb 3rd\"). Opening and closing balances, however, use value date.",

      explanation:
        "A [[statement]] shows three things: the transaction listing (booking date), opening/closing balances (value date), and daily balances from [[snapshot|snapshots]]. Holds never appear — a hold posts nothing to the ledger until captured, so a ledger-derived statement is blind to it. The overdraft limit is a deposit-layer config, not a statement line.",

      unit: "dollars",
      tolerance: 0,
      explanation:
        "Daily interest = $36,500 × 0.04 / 365 = $1,460 / 365 = **$4.00**. The end-of-day [[snapshot]] provides the exact principal for each day's accrual calculation. Without a captured end-of-day figure there is nothing to accrue against.",

      options: ["$2,550", "$1,450", "$2,000 — the opening balance carries forward unchanged", "$2,300"],
      answer: 0,
      explanation:
        "[[statement-amount|Closing balance]] = opening + credits − debits, counting only postings whose value date falls within the period. $2,000 + $850 − $300 = **$2,550**. Debits reduce the balance; credits increase it.",

      answer: true,
      explanation:
        "The [[statement-amount|closing balance]] is built from value-date snapshots. The transaction appears in February's listing because the customer performed it in February (booking date); it does not affect February's closing balance because it becomes economically real only on March 1 (value date). This design is why most statements print both dates when they differ.",

      options: [

        "In the February listing only — it has no effect on any February balance",
        "Not in the February listing, but it is part of the February opening balance",
        "In neither the February listing nor the February balances — it belongs entirely to January",
      ],
      answer: 2,
      explanation:
        "The February [[statement]] lists transactions by booking date. This posting was booked January 31, so it does not appear in February's listing. However, its [[value-date]] is February 1, which makes it economically real in February — so it is reflected in the February opening balance (which equals the January 31 end-of-day value-date snapshot).",

        "In a layered core banking system, which layer is responsible for capturing end-of-day snapshots, and why?",
      options: [
        "The general ledger, because it records all postings",
        "The deposit layer, because snapshots record the three-part balance (book, holds, available) which only the deposit layer tracks",
        "The payment layer, because snapshots are used for settlement reporting",
        "A dedicated snapshot service that sits outside the ledger hierarchy",
      ],
      answer: 1,
      explanation:
        "[[ledger-vs-subledger|Snapshots belong to the deposit layer]] (`deposit.Register`). The pure general ledger computes book balances on demand but stores no snapshots — it knows nothing about holds or available balances. Because the deposit layer owns the three-part balance, it also owns the [[snapshot]].",

      answer: 1750,
      unit: "dollars",
      tolerance: 0,
      explanation:
        "[[statement-amount|Closing balance]] = opening snapshot + credits − debits, measured by value date. $1,500 + ($200 + $350 + $100) − $400 = $1,500 + $650 − $400 = **$1,750**.",

        "Why does a bank statement's transaction listing use booking date rather than value date?",
      options: [
        "Value date is only relevant for regulatory reporting, not customer communications",
        "Booking date is when the customer recognizes having performed the transaction — it matches lived experience",
        "Booking date and value date are always the same, so the choice is arbitrary",
        "Value-date ordering would require including transactions from outside the statement period",
      ],
      answer: 1,
      explanation:
        "[[booking-date]] is the date the entry appears in the ledger — the date a customer associates with making a payment or receiving funds. Using booking date makes the listing match what the customer experienced. Balances, however, use value date for economic and regulatory accuracy, which is why the two may not reconcile.",

        "An authorization hold placed on an account appears as a line item on the account's bank statement.",
      answer: false,
      explanation:
        "[[statement|Statements]] are derived from the general ledger; a hold posts nothing to the ledger until it is captured. Until capture, the hold exists only in the deposit layer and is invisible to the ledger-based statement. Only real book movements — including captures — appear as statement lines.",

      prompt:
        "When a statement's running balance is accumulated from oldest to newest posting, what built-in correctness check does this create?",
      options: [
        "The final running balance must match the account's current book balance — any mismatch reveals a bug or data corruption",
        "The running balance must equal zero because all debits and credits cancel out over time",
        "Each line's running balance must exceed the previous line's balance (no net debits allowed)",
        "The total credits in the period must exactly match the total debits in the period",
      ],
      answer: 0,
      explanation:
        "[[balance-book|The book balance]] and the statement's accumulated running balance are independently derived from the same underlying ledger. At statement end, both figures must agree — this is the account-level equivalent of a trial balance. A mismatch signals a data integrity problem.",

      ],
      answers: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4],
      explanation:
        "The audit trail is an immutable, append-only log of **every** system mutation — not just postings. Account lifecycle events, all postings, hold operations, reversals, and [[snapshot]] captures all appear. This completeness is what enables full event replay to independently recompute any historical state.",

      prompt:
        "A $200 erroneous credit is posted to an account on March 5, then reversed on March 7. How does this appear on the March statement?",
      options: [
        "As a single net-zero entry on March 5 — the system automatically collapses corrected pairs",
        "As two separate lines: +$200 on March 5 and −$200 on March 7, both visible",
        "The March 5 entry disappears; only the reversal line is visible",
        "As a comment on the original March 5 line rather than a separate transaction",
      ],
      answer: 1,
      explanation:
        "A [[reversal]] is a brand-new, equal-and-opposite posting — the ledger is immutable and append-only, so the original entry cannot be removed or edited. Both the original and the reversal appear as separate statement lines. Their net effect is zero, but both lines remain visible, preserving the full audit trail.",

        "Run a trial balance and verify that total debits equal total credits across all accounts",
      ],
      answer: 1,
      explanation:
        "Replaying the full audit trail from first principles independently derives what every balance *must* be, without trusting any cached or [[snapshot|snapshotted]] value. If a recomputed figure disagrees with the stored balance, something is corrupt. A trial balance (option D) only confirms debit-credit equality — it cannot catch whether a particular account's balance is wrong.",

What is the May closing balance in dollars?",
      answer: 3550,
      unit: "dollars",

      explanation:
        "The April 30 snapshot captures balances for value dates ≤ April 30 only. The April 28-booked / May 2-value credit was NOT in the snapshot — its value date is in May, so it contributes to May. May closing = $3,000 + $100 + $500 − $200 + $150 = **$3,550**. This is a concrete example of why the statement-amount calculation counts postings by value date, not booking date.",

      answer: true,
      explanation:
        "[[double-entry]] ensures every posting is balanced (debits = credits), and the append-only audit trail ensures no event is ever silently removed or altered.

      answer: 1,
      explanation:
        "The [[statement]] listing uses booking date; balances use [[value-date|value date]]. A transaction booked in February but value-dating in March appears in the listing but does not move the closing balance. A transaction booked in January but value-dating in February moves the opening balance but does not appear in the listing. Both effects cause the listed transactions to not 'add up' — by design, not by error.",
