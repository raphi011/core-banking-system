        "In a push payment, which party's bank originates the payment instruction?",

      answer: 0,
      explanation:
        "In a [[scheme-direction-push]] payment the **payer's bank** originates the instruction — the payer 'pushes' funds toward the payee. SEPA Credit Transfer is the canonical example: the sender's bank submits the payment and funds flow out of the sender's account.",

      ],
      answer: 1,
      explanation:
        "In a [[scheme-direction-pull]] payment the **payee's bank** originates the instruction — the payee 'pulls' funds from the payer's account. SEPA Direct Debit works this way: the creditor's bank initiates the collection.",

      concept: "requires-mandate",
      prompt:
        "A pull payment scheme requires the payer to have signed a standing authorization (a mandate) before the payee's bank may collect funds.",
      answer: true,
      explanation:
        "Because a pull scheme lets the payee's bank initiate a debit on the payer's account, [[requires-mandate]] schemes demand that the payer pre-authorize the relationship. Without an active [[mandate]], the payment is rejected before it ever reaches the clearing step.",

      concept: "settlement-model-net",
      prompt: "What does 'net settlement' mean in a payment scheme?",
      options: [
        "Every payment is settled individually and immediately as it is submitted",
        "Payments are batched into cycles, and only each bank's net position transfers at settlement",
        "All payments are settled directly at the central bank without a clearing step",
        "Settlement occurs at a fixed time each day with no position offsetting",
      ],
      answer: 1,
      explanation:
        "[[settlement-model-net]] groups payments into clearing cycles. At the cut-off, each bank's outflows and inflows are netted, and only the residual — the net position — moves as reserves. This dramatically reduces the liquidity banks must hold compared to gross settlement.",

      prompt:
        "After netting, the sum of all banks' net positions in a clearing cycle always equals zero.",
      answer: true,
      explanation:
        "[[net-positions]] across all participants must sum to zero — every dollar one bank owes net is a dollar another bank is owed net. This is double-entry applied at the system level: money is conserved; it only moves between participants.",

      prompt:
        "A customer logs into their bank app and initiates a transfer to pay their rent. Which scheme direction describes this payment?",
      options: [
        "Pull — the landlord's bank initiates the collection",
        "Push — the customer's bank originates the instruction and sends the funds",
        "Gross — because it settles immediately",
        "Net — because it batches with other payments",
      ],
      answer: 1,
      explanation:
        "The customer is voluntarily sending money out, so the **payer's bank** originates the instruction — the defining feature of a [[scheme-direction-push]] payment. The settlement model (net or gross) is a separate axis and has no bearing on push vs pull.",

      answer: 200,
      unit: "dollars",
      tolerance: 0,
      explanation:
        "[[netting]] computes each bank's net position: Bank A net = −$300 + $100 = −$200; Bank B net = +$300 − $100 = +$200. Only **$200** of reserves transfers — not the $400 gross total. This is precisely why clearing exists as a step before settlement.",

        "Debit Reserve at Central Bank 3000 · Credit Alice's deposit 3000",
      ],
      answer: 1,
      explanation:
        "The [[debtor-leg]] at initiation is: **Debit** Alice's deposit (her balance falls) and **Credit** Clearing Suspense (Bank A now owes the network). Alice's money sits in [[clearing-suspense]] — 'in flight' — until settlement moves reserves and the creditor leg is posted at Bank B.",

        "Debit Bob's deposit · Credit Reserve at Central Bank",
      ],
      answer: 1,
      explanation:
        "The [[creditor-leg]] at settlement is: **Debit** Clearing Suspense (releasing the in-flight funds) and **Credit** Bob's deposit (his balance rises). Bank B's Clearing Suspense, which held the incoming net position, clears back to zero.",

      options: ["Initiated", "Accepted", "Cleared", "Settled"],
      answer: 1,
      explanation:
        "The [[payment-lifecycle]] state machine is Initiated → **Accepted** → Cleared → Settled. The [[debtor-leg]] is posted on the Initiated → Accepted transition, once the scheme validates the payment (sufficient funds, mandate active if required). The payment reaches Cleared only later, at the cut-off when net positions are computed.",

      prompt:
        "In a pull payment, money flows from the creditor's account to the debtor's account — the reverse of a push payment.",
      answer: false,
      explanation:
        "Money always flows **debtor → creditor**, regardless of who initiates. In a [[scheme-direction-pull]] scheme the creditor's bank *initiates* the instruction, but the economic direction of value is identical to a push: funds leave the payer (debtor) and arrive at the payee (creditor).",

        "Which of the following are properties of SEPA Direct Debit (SDD) but NOT of SEPA Credit Transfer (SCT)?",

        "Each payment settles individually without netting",
      ],
      answers: [0, 1, 2],
      explanation:
        "SDD is [[scheme-direction-pull]] — the payee's bank initiates. It [[requires-mandate]] (a signed authorization). And it [[allows-return]] — the debtor can dispute and reclaim funds after settlement via a SEPA R-transaction. SCT is push, requires no mandate, and does not define a return right. Both schemes use net settlement — not individual (gross) settlement.",

        "It is removed from the ledger until settlement",
      ],
      answer: 2,
      explanation:
        "[[clearing-suspense]] is the 'in-flight' liability account that holds funds between the [[debtor-leg]] and final settlement. Debit Alice → Credit Clearing Suspense parks the money there. At settlement, Clearing Suspense is debited as Bank A's reserve asset falls — the suspense clears to zero.",

      answer: 500,
      unit: "dollars",
      tolerance: 0,
      explanation:
        "[[settlement-model-net]] computes the net position: $10,000 outgoing − $9,500 incoming = **$500 net outflow**. Bank A's reserve account at the central bank decreases by only $500, not by the $10,000 gross outgoing total.",

        "It is cancelled automatically at the clearing cut-off",
      ],
      answer: 1,
      explanation:
        "The [[payment-lifecycle]] state for a failed payment before clearing is **Rejected**. At rejection, the debtor-leg posting is reversed — a compensating entry credits the payer's account back and clears Clearing Suspense to zero. The **Returned** state is distinct: it applies *after* a payment has already settled.",

      answer: false,
      explanation:
        "[[settlement-model-gross]] means each payment settles individually and immediately at the central bank. UK Faster Payments *feels* instant to customers but actually settles on a **deferred net basis** behind the scenes. Instant customer experience and gross settlement are independent properties — a scheme can be one without the other.",

        "[[requires-mandate]] schemes validate the mandate at the Initiated → Accepted step.
